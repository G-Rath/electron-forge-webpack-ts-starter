## @g-rath/electron-forge-webpack-ts-starter

This is an out-of-the-box starter structure for making an `electron` project,
using `typescript`, `webpack`, and `electron-forge`.

Just clone the project, run `npm i`, and you should be sweet.

It was `init`ed on a Windows 10 machine, meaning it might be missing a property
or two in the `package.json` for building for other platforms.

PRs & issues are welcomed :)
